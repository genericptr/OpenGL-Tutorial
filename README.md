# OpenGL-Tutorial
Personal tutorial for learning the OpenGL 3D graphics pipeline (from scratch with Free Pascal)

Features:

- Terrains from Perlin noise
- OBJ loader
- Multiple colored light sources
- Skybox
- Fog
- Normal maps

Most of this is me following along with ThinMatrix's excellent Java tutorial on YouTube which I strongly recommend watching. In particular the OBJ loader was translated from his code.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP
